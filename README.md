# Maplestory Mesofarming Bot

This bot is made for the Kanna class, and uses the skills Teleport, Shikigami Haunting, Shoukan Kishin, and Spirit Corral over and over to teleport across the map and kill monsters. It is recommended to get a couple pets to automatically pick up the items. This bot is created with Java using the Eclipse IDE.

The keybindings for the skills are as follows:
* S - Shikigami Haunting
* X - Shoukan Kishin
* C - Teleport
* B - Spirit Corral

## To Run

Java must be installed to run. To install Java, go to the [Java website](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml) and install the newest version of Java.

To run this program, clone the repository and then open the project in Eclispe. In the File menu, select the export option. Then, export the project as a runnable .jar file. The jar file can be double clicked on to run the program. Once the program is loaded, clicking the meso bag button or the spacebar while focusing on the application window will start the bot after 3 seconds. To pause the bot, click the meso bag again or the spacebar again while focusing on the application window.
